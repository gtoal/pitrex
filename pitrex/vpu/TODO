TODO

* Fix the compiler/makefile, or find another compiler, which can
  actually make binaries which run on their like assembly programs
  do!

* Support raster text by integrating it into the vector pipeline.

* Confirm VPU delay timing matches CPU delay timing.

* Automatically refresh the last display frame if the CPU hasn't
  updated the pipeline in time for the Vectrex's next refresh cycle.

* Ideally integrate other I/O operations (sound and controller
  inputs) VPU-side so that the Vectrex Interface lib doesn't need
  to wait for it to finish before progressing after a display
  update.

* With the above done, the Vectrex Interface lib no longer needs to
  wait for refresh intervals - it can just update the pipeline as
  often as possible and leave the VPU to keep the refresh timing
  correct.

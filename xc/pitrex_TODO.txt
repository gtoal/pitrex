* Move PiTrex display code out of dummy driver and into an
  independent graphics driver.

* Fix segmentation fault on shut-down

* Find better default dettings for vectrex mouse input driver

* Automatic display scaling in display driver

* Move uninterruptable vector drawing code to the GPU

* Support key name strings instead of numbers in key assignments
  for vectrex keyboard input driver (probably too much work to do
  that from the server side though)

  not really used much, so probably not)

  code

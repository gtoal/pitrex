# pitrex
Support for driving Vectrex display from Raspberry Pi Zero WH.

PiTrex is a open source/open hardware project.

This repository is currently aimed only at users of the PiTrex hardware - 'Developer release'.

Our intention is that everything you need to develop software for the PiTrex will be in this
repository and that you should fetch the entire repository from git.

We realise that there are some imported projects here from other repositories which we have
duplicated, but for the moment it is simpler just to have everything together.  When we have
more experience with git and packaging software, we'll reduce the overhead here and supply scripts
to install the external code.

 * the clean + invalidate performed by v7_flush_dcache_all causes a bunch
 * of cache lines with uninitialized data and uninitialized tags to get
 * written out to memory, which does really unpleasant things to the main
 * processor.  We fix this by performing an invalidate, rather than a
 * clean + invalidate, before jumping into the kernel.

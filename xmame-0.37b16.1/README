Q: What is xmame?

A: Xmame is the Unix and Unix-like port of the highly esteemed MAME system.


Q: What is MAME/MESS?

A: MAME stands for Multi Arcade Machine Emulator. As the name suggests, it is
    a program that emulates the hardware (and low-level firmware) of a massive
    variety of arcade machines.
   MESS stands for Multi Emulator Super System. It is an emulator for the
    hardware of many different games consules (e.g. Sega, NES, SNES, etc.)
    as well as many different old games-oriented home computers (e.g. C64,
    C128, ZX80, etc.)
   While the two programs are conceptually different, and have different
    development teams, they share a lot of code and are distributed together.


Q: How do I compile XMAME/XMESS?

A: The Raspberry Pi version can be compiled by using the following 3 steps:
   'make' - to create the directory structure
   'm68k.sh' - to create Musashi 68000 Op code generator
   'make' - to complete the compile. Allow 90-120 minutes if compiling on Pi.


Q: What optimizations have beem made to this version?

A: Lots! :)
   DispmanX for graphics output scaling.
   Cyclone and DrZ80 ARM assembly CPU cores for M68000 and Z80 respectively.
   Other improvements as "necessary".
   There's also an SDL version without dispmanx for non-raspberry systems.


Q: OK, I've got the source and compiled it. How do I run a game?

A: ./xmame.dispmanx.37b16 <game> 

   By default cyclone and drz80 are not enabled, to enable these specify:

   ./xmame.dispmanx.37b16 <game> -cyclone -drz80

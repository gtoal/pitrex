	* Version 1.3.

	* Updated displayed copyright text.

	* hiscore.c (writescore): fixed exploitable (for gid games)
	buffer-overrun in hi-score-writing.

	* Removed "FAQ", which wasn't particularly an FAQ and was really a
	bit pointless.

2002-04-28  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* zblast.c (playgame): fixed brokenness on second repeat of the
	levels. Thanks to Oohara Yuuma for spotting this.

2002-03-31  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* zblast.c (playgame): finally gave in and added auto-fire, but
	only when run with `-autofire', and at the cost of disabling
	high-score saving. Thanks to Oohara Yuuma for contributing the
	code, and to "Ariel" for also suggesting auto-fire support.

2000-12-17  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* Version 1.2.

	* zblast.c (snd_main): made the `loading music' bit indicate time
	passing a bit better, and used \r instead of \n when it's done.

	* Updated title.csf/ingame.csf to reflect their GPLness. (Ouch,
	glad I finally spotted this one!)

	* Makefile: various updates - mainly saner installation, and new
	uninstall target.

	* Now installed setgid games (for both versions), to avoid
	requiring (yikes) world-writable scores file.

	* zblast.c (titledraw): `xzb -small's title screen looks slightly
	better now.

	* Now defaults to 16kHz sound when available, resorting to the old
	8kHz otherwise.

	* Fixed some of the more obvious not-checking-buffer-size
	problems. I think only the SOD2_SAMPLE_PATH in grokfile.c could
	have potentially been exploitable (and even for that one I have my
	doubts).

2000-07-03  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* zblast.c: joystick support (Linux-specific). You can disable
	this at compile time if need be. Personally I find it too hard to
	keep up the fire rate on my joypad (yes, it has the option to use
	autofire, but that's Evil), and there isn't quite the control with
	a d-pad you get from cursors. Still, it's there for those who
	prefer it, and it was fun to gratuitously add support to something
	after having bought a pad. :-)

2000-03-19  Russell Marks  <rus@cartman>

	* zblast.c: sound-generating process now exits when main program
	quits abnormally, rather than hanging around.

2000-01-02  Russell Marks  <rus@cartman>

	* zblast.c: made sound effects louder.
	
	* zblast.c: made text-drawing slightly more sane, and (in X) added
	support for `delete window' message from window manager.

	* ANSIfied, caught a couple of minor problems (not really bugs as
	they happened to work previously, HHOS :-)).

	* Makefile: stopped using MORE_SOUNDBUF by default.

	* zblast.c: converted to use svgalib's raw mode support rather
	than rawkey.

Thu Jan 30 03:03:51 1997  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* Version 1.1.

	* zblast.c: made use of more sound buffer fragments a compile-time
	option.

Wed Dec 11 15:41:26 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* New `phit.raw' (finally!).

Sat Nov 23 05:06:14 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* zblast.c: added console-switching support.

Mon Nov 18 00:12:59 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* Added hi-score table.

	* zblast.c: use ints for signed values rather than char.
	(Signedness of chars is all kinds of fun in portability terms.)

Tue Nov 12 05:37:05 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* zblast.c: made sound a bit less likely to screw up (click or
 	break up), at the expense of making it less synchronous. (Now uses
 	4 snd_frag fragments instead of 2.)

	* zblast.c: added game over message, and (trivial) music for it.

Fri Mar 29 04:03:01 1996  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* Added title/in-game music via a hacked-up sod2.

	* Merged zblast and xzb.

Sun Nov 12 02:09:36 1995  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* xzb.c: added icon and put in 'don't resize' window hints.

	* xzb.icon: created.

Sat Nov 11 20:00:48 1995  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* xzb.c: now loops after finishing all levels (and speeds up).

Sat Nov 11 02:18:24 1995  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* xzb.6: created.

	* xzb.c: done colour, made unbuffered display default, allowed
	optional bigger display.

Fri Nov 10 18:17:36 1995  Russell Marks  <rus@lifeson>

	* xzb created, an X port.

Tue Nov  1 02:01:10 1994  Russell Marks  (rus@lifeson)

	* Previous significant changes: new type of bad guy (another kind
	pending), five new waves and one removed (six levels total now),
	some sounds changed - in particular Graham's cool ptowwwww sound
	is used for the baddies' shots.

	* Bugfix: it doesn't click at the end of a sound now.

	* Started changelog.

Zonn: The inside guy tracks you faster from the start, and the
fireballs are faster.  These were created by request from operators,
people were getting to good at Star Castle.  I have no idea were
Version 2 went, but I was told there was never a released Version 2.
Version 3 comes from the fact that V3 is written on the ROMs.

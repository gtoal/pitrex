Pitrex IO Lib Changes for V1.1:

*Fixed wrong value written to bcm2835_gpio_GPFSEL2 in short routines.

V1.0:

*Integrates Chris' "short" read/write functions.
*Automatically detects the Raspberry Pi model that it's running on in Linux, and uses the corresponding UART configuration.

V0.2.3:

*Modified to work with UART1 by default, or UART0 if "UART0" is defined during compilation.
*Uses local bcm2835 library file (eg. bare metal version).
*Possibly other minor modifications to equate to the modifications that Malban made to V. 0.1.

V0.2.2:

*Fixed infinate loop in vectrexread, vectrexread_on_irq, vectrexwrite, vectrexwrite_on_irq if invalid address provided.

V0.2.1:

* Add parameter to vectrexinit() that makes it initialise the VIA as well as the PiTrex/GPIO. -DONE
* Separate read and write operations so that completion can be checked after operations begun, by checking the status of the EDR.
  -Now need error handling for invalid addresses so that not waiting on canceled write to complete. -DONE
* Same approach to interrupts. -DONE
* Interrupt loops only respond to specified interrupt read from IFR after #IRQ asserted. -DONE
* Optimised read and write functions for sequential operation. - forget it, or for later
* Comment out USE_EDR definition to allow option to be passed compiler with the compilation command. -DONE

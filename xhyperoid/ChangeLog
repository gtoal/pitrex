	* Version 1.2. (Starting here to carry on from Hyperoid's version
	number.)

	* Given up on finding the original author :-/ (since I'm merely
	prefixing the original name with `x' I felt I should really ask
	permission, as it were), and decided to just release it anyway.

	* gtk.c: fixed strange X errors on exit (it seems a gdk_flush()
	was needed in gc_init(), though I don't quite see why :-/). Also
	now works in mono, though not especially well.

	* xhyperoid.6: created.

	* README: created.

	* Makefile: finished off and cleaned up a bit.

	* Tweaked level.xpm and score.xpm to be more readable (well,
	slightly less *un*readable, anyway :-)).

	* gtk.c: finally got the X version sorted out. The big speed
	problem was with doing so many colour switches with a single GC;
	using multiple `single-colour' GCs avoided the need for that.

	* gtk.c: first hack at an X version. Slow and jerky. :-(

	* Sorted out sounds. They now seem at least reasonably
	appropriate.

	* More concerted attempt at removing the most severe macro abuse.
	Also mass conversion of "//" comments.

	* hyperoid.c: fixed segfault (from original code) where NULL
	pointer was occasionally dereferenced when breaking up an
	asteroid.

	* Got score and other status indication working.

2000-03-18  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@dtn.ntl.com>

	* hyperoid.c: added sound support (lifted from zblast). Only the
	code is there at the moment; tested with zblast sounds, but need
	to put together some appropriate for this.

	* hyperoid.c: got a crude svgalib port mostly working - there's an
	intermittent segfault problem, but I suspect that was in the
	original code (not that that helps :-)), and I haven't implemented
	the score etc. display yet.

	* Started port. The first step is to try and remove the more
	obvious Windows dain bramage and unsightly Pascal/Modula-2-isms. I
	may be some time. ;-)

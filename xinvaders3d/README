XInvaders 3D v1.3.6
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
XInvaders 3D is a vector-graphics Space Invaders clone
for the X Window System.

Modified for PiTrex by Kevin Koster, 2022.

================================================================

Objective:
-=-=-=-=-=-
Clear all the aliens in each level. The UFO yields bonus 
points if hit. A new life will be added every 7500 points.

Game-over: either if the player has lost all its lives
or if the alien formation reaches the player position.

================================================================

Point System:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

From bottom to top:
Row 0 aliens yield 10  pts
Row 1 aliens yield 50  pts
Row 2 aliens yield 100 pts
Row 3 aliens yield 150 pts
Row 4 aliens yield 200 pts

UFO yields 500 pts

2             : Show frame-rate
3             : Pause game

================================================================

How to compile and play the game:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Requirements: gcc and Xlib
2. Compile the game, type: make
3. Run the game, type: ./xinv3d

note:
You may have to edit the Makefile depending on where
your headers and libraries are. For other systems please
see the README.xxx for that system.

xinv3d_pitrex is the PiTrex-direct version. The PiTrex-direct
version doesn't require X, but doesn't yet suport bare-metal. It
needs clipping to be added.

History:
-=-=-=-=-

1.3.6:
		Minor fixes.
		Changed some game text which had the wrong
		contact information.
		Made some more code clean ups.

1.3.5:
      Moved all game text to gtext.h. 
      Removed `goto' in init code.
      Put a space in ``game over.'' 

1.32-1.34:
      Minor fixes.

1.31:
      Fixed drawing order. Objects were being drawn in reverse.

1.3:
      Many thanks to Thomas Boutell, he has contributed a 
      Windows port of XInvaders 3D. See README.win for more
      information. 

      XInvaders 3D DOS port finished. XInvaders 3D will now run
      as a full-screen 640x480x8 DOS game. For windows users it 
      will run in a DOS window just fine. I used DJGPP+Allegro
      to port it. See README.dos for more information.

      Added Vector-fonts. All text graphics have been
      replaced with Vector-fonts. Gives the game a
      cleaner look.

      New player blinking routine. Player now cycles
      through red colors, rather than being drawn
      each alternate frame, when a new level
      has been started.

      New special effect: 1-UP indicator. When 7500pts
      have been reached a new life is indicated by
      a nice little vector 1-UP floating towards
      the player.

      New alien-shoot missile routine. Aliens now shoot
      more.

      New Distance-of-Point-to-Line routine, used for
      collision detection. 

      Added fix for FreeBSD systems, thanks to Peter da Silva.

      Fixed ZONE_HEIGHT bug in game.c, which was generating 
      bad pointers, thanks to Sam Bushell.

      Cleaned up code, for portability reasons, thanks to
      Thomas Boutell for his help.

      Left-Shift key is no longer being used. 

1.2: 
      Cleaned up some more code. 

      Adjusted formation movement.

      Changed missile color to yellow, suggested by Mattia Engdeg.

      Fixed some warnings which the pedantic flag generates,
      thanks to Jarmo Pussinen for pointing them out.

1.1:  
      Fixed incompatible pointer warnings.

      Fixed window manager bug which Bill Kendrick pointed out.

      Windows were opening at an odd width and height under
      the Enlightenment Window manager.

1.0:
      Initial release.

* Changes between versions   -*- mode:indented-text; mode:outline-minor -*-

This file (NEWS) documents the significant changes between all
versions of zblast since 1.2, with the newest changes first.


* Changes in zblast 1.3

Fixed exploitable (to give group-id games) buffer-overrun in
hi-score-writing.

Finally gave in and added auto-fire, but only when run with
`-autofire', and at the cost of disabling high-score saving. Thanks to
Oohara Yuuma for contributing the code, and to "Ariel" for also
suggesting auto-fire support.

Fixed brokenness on second repeat of the levels. Thanks to Oohara
Yuuma for spotting this.


* Changes in zblast 1.2

Fixed some potential buffer overruns.

Now installed setgid games (for both versions), to avoid requiring
(yikes) world-writable scores file.

Defaults to 16kHz sound when available, resorting to the old 8kHz
otherwise.

Joystick/joypad support. Not that great a way to play it IMHO, but it
was fun to gratuitously add support to something after having bought a
pad. :-) You can disable this at compile time if need be.

Saner installation, and new uninstall target.

The sound-generating process now exits when the main program quits
abnormally, rather than hanging around.

Sound effects made louder.

X version now supports `delete window' message from window manager.

svgalib version converted to use svgalib's raw mode support rather
than rawkey.

Made text-drawing slightly more sane.

The `loading music' bit indicates time passing a bit better.

* Build for the Raspberry Pi and try to get performance as quick as
  possible on there.

* Improve the accelerated mode so that it works alright on PC as
  well as Vectrex and make sure that it does the frame syncing in
  the right sequence.

* Maybe see if networked multiplayer can be made to work.
  Alternatively maybe do this at the X server level.
